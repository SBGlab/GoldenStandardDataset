# GoldenStandardDataset
Workflow and datasets from the parts characterisation from Golden Standard Moclo kit.

In this repository you will find 3 jupyter notebooks:
- **paper_datasets_workflow**: this script allows you to explore our datasets and follow the same computational analysis we performed to quantify parts activity from growth and fluorescence data. You can find it here:
- **custom_data_workflow**: script to analyse your own data following the same workflow. You will need to previously generate two .csv files with a given structure*: as well as sample info file, which you can easily create using the sample_info_file script.
- **sample_info_file**: script to easily generate sample-to-well info for processing custom experiments. We used this script also for each of our analysis. You can find it here: <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/SBGlab/GoldenStandardDataset/blob/main/create_sample_info_file.ipynb">
